        <h2>History of Hogwarts</h2>
          <p>The tenth century was a dangerous time for witches and wizards, who were being persecuted by Muggles (non-magic folk) hostile to magic. 
            Therefore, four of the greatest witches and wizards that ever lived founded Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Their names were 
            Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin. It’s a popular wizarding theory that Rowena Ravenclaw came up 
            with the name of Hogwarts after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake. It’s unknown, however, whether this is actually 
            true.

          </p>
          <p>Hogwarts was built somewhere in the Scottish Highlands, and concealed with numerous charms and spells to make it impossible for Muggles to 
            trespass. For instead of an enormous school, any passing Muggle would only see ruins and signs warning them of danger. The castle itself is 
            huge and complex, Hogwarts has a long history of ancient magic Indeed, much about the design and construction of Hogwarts remains a mystery. </p>

                Much like the Marauders, or Harry, Hermione and Ron, the founders of Hogwarts were originally friends. Yet that changed once it became clear 
                that certain founders had a very different idea of what they wanted Hogwarts to be. That founder, of course, was Salazar Slytherin, who 
                distrusted Muggle-born wizards, and believed that only ‘pure-blood’ students should be allowed to attend Hogwarts. The other founders 
                disagreed – especially Godric Gryffindor, who was, up until then, Slytherin’s greatest friend. Their argument – possibly, it’s suggested, 
                a duel – resulted in Slytherin leaving the school behind

            </p>
            <p> Rowena Ravenclaw the greatest witch of her time; a figure famed for her intelligence and wit – she wore an enchanted diadem, which was 
                said to enhance the wisdom of the wearer. Such a witch casts a long shadow, one her daughter Helena found it difficult to escape from. 
                Envying her mother’s status and power, she betrayed her by stealing the diadem – believing it could make her powerful – and ran away 
                from Hogwarts. The betrayal embarrassed Rowena, who told no one, including her fellow founders, that the diadem was missing,</p>
              
            <p> Helga Hufflepuff who was apparently the founder responsible for giving house-elves jobs in the kitchens, giving them 
               somewhere to work where they would be treated fairly, and not be abused. She was also very good at food-related charms, and her recipes 
               are still used by Hogwarts for their feasts.</p>

            <p> Godric Gryffindor favoured the virtues of courage and heroism, and has been described by J.K. Rowling as ‘the best duellist of his time’ — 
                both with a wand, and a sword. Thus his legacy lives on with the Sword of Gryffindor, the relic that Harry Potter used to destroy Horcruxes. 
                But he also endures through another object. You see, when the founders became older, they were faced with a problem: how would they ensure 
                that students were sorted into the right House after they were gone? For up until that point, that decision was made by them and them alone. 
                The solution? Godric’s hat. The founders decided that the best course of action was for Godric to take off his hat so that all four of them 
                could enchant it to sort students long after their deaths. And lo, the Sorting Hat was born.</p>
